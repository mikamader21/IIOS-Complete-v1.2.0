# IIOS Project State

**Version:** 1.2.1  
**Review date:** 22 July 2026  
**Phase:** 0 — Foundation  
**Status:** Foundation v1.2.0 ratified by Owner and merged to `main`. v1.2.1 is a technical portability patch (cross-platform Invariant Kernel checksum, `.gitattributes`, Windows+Ubuntu CI) with no change to ratified constitutional content.

## Approved design direction proposed for ratification

- Hermes is a subordinate persistent runtime.
- Models are selected through `config/model-registry.json`; no vendor/model is constitutional.
- Obsidian is a human knowledge surface; Graphify is derived and rebuildable.
- `AGENTS.md` is the shared project instruction source; `CLAUDE.md` imports it.
- Operational state belongs in PostgreSQL/Supabase; authority remains in governed Git documents and deterministic policy.
- Financial connectors remain read-only.
- Deployment progresses local → private hybrid VPS → personal production.
- Docker Compose precedes Kubernetes.
- One governed workflow precedes persistent agent teams.
- Cowork external write connectors remain disabled/read-only until Governance mediation exists.
- The Invariant Kernel is a versioned, hashed policy bundle under `governance/invariant-kernel/`.

## Current objective

Ratify Foundation v1.2.0, merge through a protected pull request and verify repository controls. Do not implement domain agents yet.

## Foundation acceptance criteria

- [x] Owner ratifies Master Charter and Constitution.
- [x] Owner ratifies ADR-0007, ADR-0008 and ADR-0009.
- [x] Cowork write-capable connectors are disabled or explicitly restricted to read-only.
- [x] `python scripts/verify_foundation.py` passes locally and in GitHub Actions, on both Ubuntu and Windows (v1.2.1).
- [ ] Main branch protection requires the verification workflow.
- [ ] No unresolved Critical finding remains.
- [ ] Action classes and approval rules are accepted.
- [ ] Threat model and fail-closed behavior are accepted.
- [ ] Repository and Vault are private with independent backups.
- [ ] Secret handling and environment separation are defined.
- [ ] Governance API interfaces are specified before implementation.
- [ ] Audit and cost event schemas are specified before implementation.
- [ ] First read-only domain is selected.

## Proposed first domain

FundingPips/prop-firm observability in read-only mode: account status, balance/equity, drawdown/rules, history, alerts and calendar; no order endpoints.

## Owner decisions still required

1. Ratify Charter, Constitution and ADR-0007/0008/0009.
2. Confirm disconnection/read-only restriction of Cowork connectors.
3. Select Supabase managed versus self-hosted PostgreSQL.
4. Select VPS provider and monthly ceiling.
5. Set daily and monthly model-cost hard limits.
6. Confirm first domain.
7. Decide Vault sync method; backup remains separate.

## Prohibited assumptions

Research cost ranges are not budgets. Runtime self-evolution is not production-approved. Graphify is not authoritative. GPU is optional. Connector availability is not permission. No autonomous financial action is authorized.
