# ADR-0008 — Claude Cowork Security Boundary

**Status:** Proposed for Owner ratification  
**Date:** 22 July 2026

## Decision

During Foundation, Cowork is restricted to supervised read-only research and document analysis. Write-capable external connectors remain disconnected or read-only until Governance capability issuance and audit exist.

## Prohibited current actions

Database writes/migrations, Make scenario execution, Notion/Drive writes, deployments, cloud-resource changes, payments and financial operations.

## Consequence

Cowork remains valuable for analysis without creating an unmediated external side-effect path.
